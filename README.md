# crimtools
Crimtools will include a suite of useful materials and tools related to criminal law in North Carolina. As an attorney and a developer, my goal in this repo is to help other attorneys interacting with clients, many of whom have questions about sentencing, jail credit, and the risk to which they are exposed by criminal charges. Nothing in crimtools should be seen as legal advice or a substitute for the advice of a licensed attorney on a specific case. 

As of 10/6/2020, this repo includes a spreadsheet list of charges from Chapter 14 of the NC General Statutes along with the class levels of all the charges. This information was gleaned from the NCGS website over the last several weeks and is currently posted at https://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/ByChapter/Chapter_14.html
