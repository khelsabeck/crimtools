# crimtools
Crimtools will include a suite of useful materials and tools related to criminal law in North Carolina. As an attorney and a developer, my goal in this repo is to help other attorneys interacting with clients, many of whom have questions about sentencing, jail credit, and the risk to which they are exposed by criminal charges. Nothing in crimtools should be seen as legal advice or a substitute for the advice of a licensed attorney on a specific case.
